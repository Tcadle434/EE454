EE454 Project 1
===============

## RUNNING THE CODE

   1. To run the Neural Network over the 10,000 test images stored in the
project's .mat files, run main.m.  The program will produce an out variable
containing the CNN's classifications for each image and the confusion matrix.
The confusion matrix will also be surface plotted.

   2. The demo.m program will run the Neural Network over a single image, and
display intermediate output at each layer.  The final classification is
displayed by a bar chart.

   3. The exploratory_main.m program will run the Neural Network over our 110
extra images.  The output is the same as (1).
